Refer to the shared doc under gdrive for better intructions.

Each of the *triples/ directories has 10 files, one for each domain covered by the challenge:
Airport
Astronaut
Building
City
ComicsCharacter
Food
Monument
SportsTeam
University
WrittenWork

For each one of those files, there is also a clean_*original_name* file, only with the sentences, for each entry. 

The clean files make easier to perform NER and other tasks.
